Recem is a repository of data and models for use in the modeling and
policy making community. The software repository is

==========
Motivation
==========

The world faces the triple challenges of environmentally sustainable
development, increasing energy demand and climate change. These challenges can
only be addressed by technological development, innovative policies, and a
restructuring of the economy.  The need to explore and analyze  the impact of
policies and alternative growth paradigms have made energy and climate
economics modeling necessary tools for development policies, long-term planning
and policy analysis and implementation.

The goal of this project is to rapidly increase access to these
modeling tools, especially in developing countries. Most current models are
based on expensive commercial software, and are often closed. This hampers
capacity building in this domain, especially in developing countries. The lack
of access and openness also obstructs the intellectual process of research.
Finally, tools that impact policy should be open and transparent in a
functional democracy. Reproducibility, and independent verification, are
important elements in the use of these complex models.

An open source development framework is the solution to most of these issues.
The models, model development process, data and research output should all be
in the public domain, and run on open source and free software. In principle,
anybody should be able to modify and run these models on their computer. This
will also facilitate the  contribution  of experts in  related fields,
and encourage  collaborative research.
