Motivation

The world faces the triple challenges of environmentally sustainable
development, increasing energy demand and climate change. These challenges can
only be addressed by technological development, innovative policies, and a
restructuring of the economy.  The need to explore and analyze  the impact of
policies and alternative growth paradigms have made energy and climate
economics modeling necessary tools for development policies, long-term planning
and policy analysis and implementation.

The goal of the proposed project is to rapidly increase access to these
modeling tools, especially in developing countries. Most current models are
based on expensive commercial software, and are closed.  This hampers capacity
building in this domain, especially in developing countries [1]. The lack of
access and openness also obstructs the intellectual process of research.
Finally, tools that impact policy should be open and transparent in a
functional democracy.

The open source framework can remedy many of these issues. The models,
model development process, data and research output are all in the public
domain, and run on open source and free software. In principle, anybody should
be able to modify and run these models on their computer. The open  source
framework  will facilitate the  contribution  of experts in related fields,
and encourage  collaborative research.
