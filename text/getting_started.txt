Installation Instructions
*************************


System requirements
===================

Recem [https://github.com/shoibalc/Recem/] has been tested against
Python 2.7 on Linux (Ubuntu 11.10) and the latest version of Coopr.
Recem should work on all Linux computers but it might take some work
to get it to run on Windows or Mac OS X.


Installation Prerequisites
==========================

* **Python 2.7**:

  Linux: Python is an open source,  high level interpreted language
  that is very intuitive to learn and easy to program in. Python
  should be available on every Linux/Unix system. Check the version
  using:

     $ python -V

  Install Python 2.7 from your Linux distribution repository if your
  version is older than that. On Ubuntu or Debian, the following
  command will do:

     $ sudo apt-get install python2.7

  Other Linuxes have similar commands: "yum" instead of "apt-get" on
  Fedora or RedHat.

  Windows: Install Python from this website:

     http://www.python.org/getit/windows/

  Macs: Macs come pre-installed with Python but the versions might be
  old. Install version 2.7 from this website:

     http://www.python.org/getit/mac/

* **Coopr**:

  Coopr is A COmmon Optimization Python Repository - a collection of
  open source optimization packages in Python. Install Coopr from this
  website:

     https://software.sandia.gov/trac/coopr/wiki/GettingStarted

  We recommend that you use Options 2-4 (3 for Windows). Options 2-4
  set up a virtual Python environment which is a local and isolated
  Python environment that mimics a complete Python installation. See

  http://www.virtualenv.org/

  for more on virtual Python installations. We will install Recem in
  this virtual Python environment. The virtual Python environment
  comes with setuptools [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools] and
  pip [http://www.pip-installer.org] - two very handy programs to
  install and manage other Python packages.

* **COIN-OR Solvers**:

  COIN-OR is COmputational INfrastructure for Operations Research - an
  initiative to promote the development of open source software in
  operations research. We will use the solvers of COIN-OR. Install the
  solver executables from this website:

     http://www.coin-or.org/projects/CoinBinary.xml

  You should obtain the appropriate executables from the 'Download
  Binaries' link. Follow instruction their Installation help files to
  make sure that solvers are on your PATH (your operation system
  should know where to find them!). We will the solver Ipopt for DICE.


Install Recem
=============

We will install using the Python of the virtual Python installation of
Coopr. Assume that the Python executable of the virtual environment is
"/path/to/coopr/bin/python".

Your's might be different. We assume that you have unzipped and saved
the Recem  zip file [https://github.com/shoibalc/Recem/zipball/master]
in the directory Recem. In this directory, type the following
commands:

   $ /path/to/coopr/bin/python setup.py develop

This will install a 'development' version of Recem. You can make
changes, uninstall Recem using:

   $ /path/to/coopr/bin/python setup.py develop --uninstall

and, compile and reinstall it again.

To see other options, type:

   $ /path/to/coopr/bin/python setup.py -h


Try it
======

Type the following commands:

   $ cd recem/dice
   $ /path/to/coopr/bin/python runDICE1993.py
   $ /path/to/coopr/bin/python runDICE2007.py


Development install
===================

If you want to make the best use of version control you should use
**git**. If you do not have git you can install it by typing:

   $ sudo apt-get install git

in Debian/Ubuntu Linux. See http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect
for help on setting up git for Mac and Windows. http://gitref.org/ has
a quick reference.

You can use git to clone Recem into a directory (say Recem):

   $ git clone git@github.com:shoibalc/Recem.git Recem

The rest of the installation process is the same as the installation
from the zip file
